Projects for the [Program Verification Master's course](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02245) in Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

- [Project A](https://pv.cmath.eu/projects/construction.html#sec-project-a) involves the development of an automated verification tool for a small imperative programming language called MicroViper, a subset of [Viper (ETH Zurich)](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html).
- [Project B](https://pv.cmath.eu/projects/methodology.html) focuses on using Viper to solve verification challenges and develop new verification methodologies.
